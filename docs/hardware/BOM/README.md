# Bill of Materials (BOM) repository

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive list of all assemblies and their corresponding files in the BOM repository. It also includes details on sheet metal parts, fasteners, technological operations, and origin components.

## Sheet metal parts

Sheet metal parts are subject to production variations. The current designs are based on the following coefficients and radii:

- **Coefficient (K):** 0.47
- **Sheet metal specifications:**
  - **0.8 mm Sheet:** Radius (R) = 1.2
  - **1.2 mm Sheet:** Radius (R) = 1.5
  - **2.0 mm Sheet:** Radius (R) = 2.4

### Post-production

- Parts may be painted after bending.
- Riveting nuts can be installed before painting if the threaded part is protected from the coating.
- Screws installed without lock washers should be secured with a thread lock (e.g., Loxeal 55-03).

**Note:** All components are highly interconnected and their functionality is dependent on one another.
