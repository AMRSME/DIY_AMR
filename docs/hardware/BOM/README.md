## Description

Sheet metal parts vary by production. Currently, the parts are designed for the following coefficients and radii:
- **K=0.47**:
  - Sheet 0.8 mm - R=1.2
  - Sheet 1.2 mm - R=1.5
  - Sheet 2.0 mm - R=2.4

After bending, parts could be painted. After painting, we install riveting nuts. It is allowed to install riveting nuts before painting, provided that the threaded part of the nuts is protected from coating. Screws installed without lock washers should be fixed with a thread lock (e.g., Loxeal 55-03). 
All details are strongly interconnected and depend on each other.
